## Summary

In order to ensure FISSION Codes are accessible on a global scale, this module strives to provide translations of FISSION Codes in different languages, phrasings, and in varying levels of technical detail.

Our collected translations are always evolving. If you would like to get involved in the project, check out the [Spade Builders community repo](https://github.com/spadebuilders/community) for more information!

## An Implementation of EIP-1444
[EIP-1444](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1444): an on-chain system for providing user feedback by converting machine-efficient codes into human-readable strings in any language or phrasing. The system does not impose a list of languages, but rather lets users create, share, and use the localized text of their choice.
